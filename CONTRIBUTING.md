## Code Style

This project uses [EditorConfig] to tell editors what formatting to use.
It's built into many editors and there are plugins for nearly every other editor that will automatically enforce the formatting.
If you want to handle it manually you can look at the [.editorconfig] file to see the rules to follow.

# Testing

Running the tests using `rake` (with no args) will also check for style issues in the code.
Ideally all submissions would pass these checks.
If the code style is causing issues we can work with you to correct it.
Don't let it stop you from contributing.
